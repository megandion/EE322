## Lab 01 Results

During the lab, I followed the "Nerdy Dave" tutorial for starting with VHDL. The turotial walked step-by-step through the Half Adder example below. I worked on the 4 to 1 Mutliplexer part following the same steps and the code uploaded to Prof. Lu's GitHub repository.

**4 to 1 Multiplexer**

I am still working on this part of the lab. There seems to be an error in the vcd file which is causing the file size to become very large. This is leading to an error when executing the "gtkwave" representation.
