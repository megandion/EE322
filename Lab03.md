## Lab 03 Results

During the lab, I followed the Lesson 3 steps on Prof. Lu's GitHub repository to setup my RaspberryPi. Screenshots of the commands are shown below.

I ran into an error with the sun.py, moon.py, and coordinates.py functions. The error noted 'astral' is not a package. 
I intstalled all three packages (jdcal, astral, and geopy) using the following code: 
`$sudo apt install python3-xxx `
The rest of the functions ran smoothly.
